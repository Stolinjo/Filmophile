                once knew. Making the decision that he has to make, he then calls his wife, his sons, his co-workers and
                boss telling them the secret that he is bearing and trying to keep his job and family intact. But even

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, a successful construction manager who makes a major decision on his journey
                home which will impact on every aspect of his life. <br />
                <br />
                This a low budget drama from writer and director Steven Knight with Hardy the sole screen presence. As
                he takes to the road he is seemingly a man in control of his destiny, determined to do the right thing
                only for everything to slowly unravel. Through conversations on the phone he tries to negotiate an
                emerging crisis at work with his boss and an evolving domestic situation with a concerned wife and sons
                desperate to have their dad home to watch the football. <br />
                <br />
                With a premise of just one actor in a confined location it is testament to Hardy's acting nous that he
                can pull off such a taught, powerful performance solely based on reactions to the increasingly dramatic
                phone calls. Locke is unrelenting in his belief of doing the right thing and we see why when he has
                imagined conversations with his father, an apparently neglectful and emotionally absent figure in his
                life. These scenes in particular are beautifully shot with the use of Locke looking into the car mirrors
                for the man who isn't there. <br />
                <br />
                It wastes very little of its short running time and overall is a captivating and rewarding film with a
                terrific central performance.
