            <h2>Mini Bio:</h2>
            <p>After training as a painter (he storyboards his films as full-scale paintings), Kurosawa entered the film
                industry in 1936 as an assistant director, eventually making his directorial debut with Sugata Sanshirô
                (1943). Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative
                freedom. Yoidore tenshi (1948)--"Drunken Angel"--was the first film he made without extensive studio
                interference, and marked his first collaboration with Toshirô Mifune. In the coming decades, the two
                would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa's films as was John
                Wayne with the films of Kurosawa's idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa
                made his international breakthrough film Rashômon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice
                Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw
                the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Shichinin no samurai (1954), the barbaric,
                riveting Shakespeare adaptation Kumonosu-jô (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies Yôjinbô (1961)
                and Tsubaki Sanjûrô (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa
                attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodesukaden (1970),
                a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford
                Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for
                Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's "King Lear." He continued to work into his eighties with
                the more personal Yume (1990), Hachi-gatsu no rapusodî (1991) and Maadadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films
                have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his
                adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan
                Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashômon
                (1950) as The Outrage (1964), Shichinin no samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yôjinbô
                (1961), as Per un pugno di dollari (1964) and Kakushi-toride no san-akunin (1958), as Star Wars (1977).
