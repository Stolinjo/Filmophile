                were helped in large part by the huge amount of drugs and alcohol kept in their convertible, The Red
                Shark.

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>When you start watching this movie, you'll decide if you like it or not. But if you don't want to wait,
                I'll tell you. This movie is so trippy, so gross, so insane, so bizarre, and so friggin' crazy! Now with
                that said, it's also brilliant, funny, surreal, dark, entertaining etc. The story goes like this; a Dr.
                Journalism, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his wolf man attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), are sent
                to Las Vegas to cover a Mint 400 motorcycle race but end up abandoning that in search of the American
                Dream. The two characters are out of their minds on drugs the entire time which is where the surreal
                factor comes into play. The film is based the famous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which was based on
                real life events he experienced. I'm not kidding when I say that five minutes into this movie and you'll
                feel that someone drugged your drink or something. This is more than just a movie, it's an experience,
                and an experience like no other. If you haven't read the book or don't know what your getting yourself
                into, then you're gonna have one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp (of course) nails the performance of the
                character that the book created. What director, Terry Gilliam, did is take the book and match the images
                that we thought of while reading it, perfectly. Throughout the film, watching the two characters wander
                witlessly around Las Vegas tripping on acid, I felt like I was part of the experience. Also, Depp's
                performance is so good, that I started to forget that he wasn't really Hunter S. Thompson. The
                characters are both psychotic but in different ways. Raoul Duke has one foot in reality and another foot
                in a pit of madness, Gonzo, however, is off his rocker. He's just a ticking atom bomb ready to go off,
                I'd be scared to stay in the same room as him. But what keeps this movie going strong is the narration
                by Depp. Some of it's recited from the book but other times it's whatever's on his mind. Without the
                narration, the movie would be just one wacky thing after another. Overall, watching this movie is like
                being hit by a car, sucked into a tornado, spat out into a trampoline factory, raped by a wild tiger,
                eaten by Godzilla, thrown off the face of the Earth, and plummeting right down on the TV. Any negative
                reviews you may have heard about this movie make no sense. They love the book while hate the film for
                being so crazy and shapeless (oh, you mean exactly like the book). This is a perfect adaptation of the
                book. So great performances, surreal scenery, flowing narration, and a clever cameo by Thompson himself.
                When I first saw this movie, I liked it just fine. I've seen a few more times and every time I see it,
                it gets better. Now it's gotten to the point where I think it's one of the best films ever made. So if
                you're a Johnny Depp fan, or a Terry Gilliam fan, or a Hunter S. Thompson fan, or just in the mood for
                something different and I mean REALLY different, definitely check it out.
