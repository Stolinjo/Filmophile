            <p>Memento chronicles two separate stories of Leonard, an ex-insurance investigator who can no longer build
                new memories, as he attempts to find the murderer of his wife, which is the last thing he remembers. One
                story line moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time.

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on
                this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating. But, as
                an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.<br />
                <br />
                Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so
                you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie. This is a highly intelligent and
                original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards. The story
                and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.<br />
                <br />
                Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby: a man who lost his short term memory in an
                assault where his wife was raped and murdered; now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.
                Simple as that. You don't need to know anymore.<br />
                <br />
                The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard
                Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex
                performance. This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and
                especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days. Four Stars!<br />
                <br />
                This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me
                later.
