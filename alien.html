            <p>In the distant future, the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo are on their way home when they pick
                up a distress call from a distant moon. The crew are under obligation to investigate and the spaceship
                descends on the moon afterwards. After a rough landing, three crew members leave the spaceship to
                explore the area on the moon. At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature,
                the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a distress call. When one of the eggs is
                disturbed, the crew realizes that they are not alone on the spaceship and they must deal with the
                consequences.

            <p>'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made.
                Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think
                anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in
                my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his
                first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long
                past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless.
                Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan
                O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including
                the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked
                how the cast were character actors and not "stars" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who
                will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being
                one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first
                released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much
                else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and
                the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking "below deck" crew. Many people seem
                to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to
                action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in
                the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend
                highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!
