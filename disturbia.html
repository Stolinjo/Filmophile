            <p>After his father is killed in a car accident, things unravel for Kale Brecht and he is placed under
                house-arrest for punching his Spanish teacher. Having nothing better to do, Kale occupies himself by
                spying on his neighbors. But one night, he witnesses what appears to be a murder going on in Mr.
                Turner's house. Kale becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind these murders but, after a few
                unsettling run-ins with Mr. Turner, it becomes a matter of life and death. And the ominous question: Who
                is watching whom?

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look
                out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions, he finds that his neighbor might be a
                killer and by doing so, tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise, and
                that premise alone, is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of
                tension and technical genius, Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script, no credit listed
                to the writers of that classic, and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and
                mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest
                anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every
                romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl, boy must win girl, conflict
                causes relationship to stay strained, boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every rom-com follows
                that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a
                premise, updates it, and makes it his own. <br />
                <br />
                Worried that this might end up as another lame duck attempt from the director, I didn't have too lofty
                of expectations. I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf, ever since his "Even Stevens" days, and knew he could give
                it credibility. Fortunately, after the highly disappointing Taking Lives and the ho-hum Two for the
                Money, it seems Caruso has come back to the form he had with his brilliant debut Salton Sea. Maybe it
                was the recent work on "The Shield," but we have some nice grit, close-up composition, and stylish
                camera-work. The realism from Sea is back and Disturbia brings it all to make one of the most
                entertaining films I've seen this year. We have fantastic humorLaBeouf's delivery and everyman rapport
                lends to this wellas well as effective scares and edge of your seat suspense. This is a PG-13 movie
                that knows what it is and rather than titillate with coming as close to the line as possible, stays in
                check and deals out a healthy dose of mood and emotion rather than blood and sex. I'd even go as far as
                saying Sarah Roemer's girl-next-door is the most sensual role this year. It is all about her confidence
                and eyes, her body language makes it work, and you fall for her just as LaBeouf does, whereas the usual
                R-rated nudity and over the top craziness has been going so far as to numb audiences by doing what every
                film now does. Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering
                pieces of the story only when we need to know them. <br />
                <br />
                Besides LaBeouf, Roemer, and a funny turn from Aaron Yoo, the main driving force here is David Morse.
                This gem of a character actor is at the top of his game as the villainous, did he or didn't he,
                neighborhood serial killer. He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around
                him has forced him to, (like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley), but he is perfect as the all
                out creepy, sly-smiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women. Morse was allowed
                to run free and he took the opportunity and went even further with it. Where many suspense films like
                this would become laughable eventually, the realism brought out through LaBeouf and Morse keep the
                audience enthralled and interested in how everything will play out. I was never bored and at times
                actually wondering what would happen next because I was so caught up. When the climax comes, I actually
                was surprised thinking it was crazy that they would get us there so early, but I was just so into it
                that I didn't realize how much time had past. <br />
                <br />
                Disturbia is a genre film and won't be winning any awards any time soon. What it may lack in total
                originality it more than makes up for in mood and effective thrills. It had everything you could want
                from a movie without making you have to think too much. Sit down, go for the ride and walk out of the
                theatre with the knowledge that your time was well spent. D.J. Caruso, thank you for redeeming yourself.
