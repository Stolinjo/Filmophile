            <p>Protagonist Alex DeLarge is an "ultraviolent" youth in futuristic Britain. As with all luck, his
                eventually runs out and he's arrested and convicted of murder and rape. While in prison, Alex learns of
                an experimental program in which convicts are programmed to detest violence. If he goes through the
                program, his sentence will be reduced and he will be back on the streets sooner than expected. But
                Alex's ordeals are far from over once he hits the mean streets of Britain that he had a hand in
                creating.

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind
                manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice,
                and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to
                a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it
                is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any
                age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's
                former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks
                of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and
                angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at
                times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film
                achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical
                music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to
                explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by
                watching the film itself.
