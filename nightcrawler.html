            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p>NIGHTCRAWLER is a thriller set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles. Jake Gyllenhaal
                stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A.
                crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other
                mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling - where each police siren wail
                equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as
                Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and
                participant to become the star of his own story. Written by Open Road Films</p>

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>From Welles to De Niro to Hanks to Bale, Hollywood has a history of actors going through extreme body
                transformations. While Gyllenhaal's intense weight loss will easily fit this trend, to only focus on
                that part of his commitment to Nightcrawler would be overlooking how impressively gone he is as Louis
                Bloom, the focus of this intense character study about an overlooked and disturbed individual. It's not
                a particularly "pleasant" film, and the pacing is far from quick, but the tension between Louis and his
                world progresses so beautifully as to pin you right to your seat. Nightcrawler is an effectively scary,
                uncomfortably funny, and stylishly gritty tour de force. The premise, plot and protagonist are truly
                unique: a sociopath becomes a freelance news-cameraman, stopping at nothing to succeed. Though his arc
                seems implausible, Gilroy crafts it smoothly, and Gyllenhaal's disturbed perfection make it hard NOT to
                believe. His unsettling bug-eyed expression and breathtakingly inappropriate smile are magnetic. Much
                like Scorsese's Rupert Pupkin, Bloom seems to believe he is the star of his own story: delusional,
                bull-headed, and respectably determined. Luckily, there is more here than just Gyllenhaal; powerful
                set-pieces resound, and the beautifully cool ambient guitar score is among the best of the year,
                complimenting Gyllenahaal's uneasy intensity. Even the camera consistently reminds us where Bloom stands
                in the deeply LA locale. At the heart, it's smartly calling out our propensity for praising characters
                for their desires, reminding us that compassionless ambition is extremely dangerous. For our
                fame-starved culture, Nightcrawler is a good message within a great movie with an even greater lead
                performance. A true don't-miss!</p>
