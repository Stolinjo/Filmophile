            <h2>Mini Bio:</h2>
            <p>Ernst Ingmar Bergman was born July 14, 1918, the son of a priest. The film and T.V. series, Den goda
                viljan (1992) is biographical and shows the early marriage of his parents. The film 'Söndagsbarn'
                depicts a bicycle journey with his father. In the miniseries Enskilda samtal (1996) is the trilogy
                closed. Here, as in 'Den Goda Viljan' Pernilla August play his mother. Note that all three movies are
                not always full true biographical stories. He began his career early with a puppet theatre which he, his
                sister and their friends played with. But he was the manager. Strictly professional he begun writing in
                1941. He had written a play called 'Kaspers död' (A.K.A. 'Kaspers Death') which was produced the same
                year. It became his entrance into the movie business as Stina Bergman (not a close relative), from the
                company S.F. (Swedish Filmindustry), had seen the play and thought that there must be some dramatic
                talent in young Ingmar. His first job was to save other more famous writers' poor scripts. Under one of
                that script-saving works he remembered that he had written a novel about his last year as a student. He
                took the novel, did the save-poor-script job first, then wrote a screenplay on his own novel. When he
                went back to S.F., he delivered two scripts rather than one. The script was Hets (1944) and was the fist
                Bergman screenplay that was put into film (by Alf Sjöberg). It was also in that movie Bergman did his
                first professional film-director job. Because Alf Sjöberg was busy, Bergman got the order to shoot the
                last sequence of the film. Ingmar Bergman is the father of Daniel Bergman, director, and Mats Bergman,
                actor at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater. Ingmar Bergman was also C.E.O. of the same theatre between
                1963-1966, where he hired almost every professional actor in Sweden. In 1976 he had a famous tax
                problem. Bergman had trusted other people to advise him on his finances, but it turned out to be very
                bad advice. Bergman had to leave the country immediately, and so he went to Germany. A few years later
                he returned to Sweden and made his last theatrical film Fanny och Alexander (1982) (A.K.A. 'Fanny and
                Alexander'). In later life he retired from movie directing, but still wrote scripts for film and T.V.
                and directed plays at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre for many years. He died peacefully in his sleep
                on July 30, 2007.</p>
