            <p>'Huggo' is recounting his life story to a reporter. He's less than clear, often times thinking that he is
                34 years of age, others, will over 100.. But his story becomes more confusing after he does focus on the
                fact of his current real age..

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>Jaco Van Dormael's third & long awaited movie is a sensation. It is a real shame that this masterpiece
                didn't won lots of awards at different film festivals. How could they be so blind ? Mr. Nobody is a
                unique cocktail of drama, love story & science fiction. It's an odyssey about making choices and the
                effect it has upon our lives. The songs ( Buddy Holly ! Pixies ! Satie ! ) are well chosen and the
                acting ( Jared Leto ! Rhys Ifans ! ) is outstanding. Some might say that this is a difficult movie and a
                bit "arty farty"... I agree that you won't understand everything, that's for sure, but what the heck,
                just sit back and enjoy the ride ! This breathtaking tale of imagination leaves you astonished in your
                seat. Not to be missed !
