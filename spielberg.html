            <h2>Mini Bio:</h2>
            <p>One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best
                known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of
                commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or
                writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975), and he has done more to define popular
                film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.<br />
                <br />
                Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist
                and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His
                parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon
                Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State
                University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an
                uncredited assistant editor on the classic western Wagon Train (1957). Among his early directing efforts
                were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground
                that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children
                as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All
                of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would
                portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens
                invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968,
                he directed Amblin' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in
                which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin' also became the name of his production company,
                which turned out such classics as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic
                early directing project, Duel (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on
                TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling's Night Gallery (1969), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969)
                and Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his
                directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over
                the world.<br />
                <br />
                Spielberg's first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film
                that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international
                superstar among directors: Jaws (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the
                summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the
                classic Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a
                classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and
                followed that effort with Used Cars (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt
                Russell\\Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with
                Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced
                and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all
                time up to that point was the alien story E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Spielberg also helped
                pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key
                when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of
                Reese's Pieces in "E.T." Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects
                movies, like "E.T." and "Close Encounters", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed
                for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up "Raiders" with Indiana Jones and
                the Temple of Doom (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of
                its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as The Goonies
                (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins (1984). He also produced the cartoon
                An American Tail (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,
                however, was the blockbuster Back to the Future (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar.
                As director, Spielberg took on the book The Color Purple (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey,
                with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Empire of the Sun (1987), a mixed
                success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.<br />
                <br />
                The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced
                the landmark animation/live-action film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be
                another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always (1989) as well as Indiana Jones and
                the Last Crusade (1989), and Back to the Future Part II (1989). All three of the films were box-office
                and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989), with Jack
                Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation
                and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark "Who Framed
                Roger Rabbit", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Adventures (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Pinky and
                the Brain (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998), Family Dog (1993) and
                Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as The Land Before Time (1988), We're
                Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993), Casper (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action
                version of The Flintstones (1994), where he was credited as "Steven Spielrock". Spielberg also produced
                many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials.
                Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook (1991) and produced such films as the
                cute fantasy Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991). He also
                produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990), Back to the Future Part III (1990) and
                Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not
                quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg
                directed Jurassic Park (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of
                all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were
                not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Schindler's List (1993), a stirring film about
                the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped
                found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.<br />
                <br />
                As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as The Mask of Zorro
                (1998), Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that
                Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad (1997), a spectacular film that was
                shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in
                late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career:
                Saving Private Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It
                was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998).<br />
                <br />
                Spielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001), The Haunting (1999) and Shrek (2001).
                he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park (1993), which were financially but not particularly
                critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a
                financial and critical success: Band of Brothers (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its
                parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was
                back in the director's chair for Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001), a movie with a message and a huge
                budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.<br />
                <br />
                Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He
                produced the short-lived TV series Seaquest DSV (1993), an anthology series entitled Amazing Stories
                (1985), created the video-game series "Medal of Honor" set during World War Two, and was a starting
                producer of ER (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and
                Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers,
                and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to
                Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in
                entertainment.</p>
