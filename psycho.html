            <p>Patrick Bateman is handsome, well educated and intelligent. He is twenty-seven and living his own
                American dream. He works by day on Wall Street, earning a fortune to complement the one he was born
                with. At night he descends into madness, as he experiments with fear and violence.

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>This is a frightening and wildly satiric look into the mentality of the high-flying Reaganomics 1980s as
                the American Dream turned into the psychotic American Nightmare. The film will probably turn as many
                people off as are entertained by this weird journey that is a slightly more organized cousin of FEAR &
                LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.<br />
                <br />
                Christian Bale is amazingly energetic and even sympathetic as the deranged, soul-less creature who
                values nothing but surface appearances. We are given a hauting roller-coaster ride through a comedy of
                terrors that is the mind of this being who seems human but isn't quite sure himself. In fact, he doesn't
                even know who or what he is.<br />
                <br />
                Is he insane? Are we? That's the joker in the gamble. That's the riddle of the sphinx that we are left
                to solve -- if there is a solution.
