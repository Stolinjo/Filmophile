            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p>Marty McFly, a typical American teenager of the Eighties, is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a
                plutonium-powered DeLorean "time machine" invented by a slightly mad scientist. During his often
                hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and
                fall in love - so he can get back to the future.

            <p>BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F.
                Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's "It's a Wonderful Life"? Think about it. Very
                popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's "Family
                Ties", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered
                DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr.
                Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney). There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his
                chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish. High-concept
                hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.
                Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were
                different...see what I mean. Oscar-nominated song "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun
                cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film. Classic.
