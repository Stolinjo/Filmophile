            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p> Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) are two hit men who are out to
                retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Wallace has
                also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out a few days later when Wallace himself will be
                out of town. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his fight.
                The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny,
                bizarre and uncalled-for incidents. Written by Soumitra</p>

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>One of the early scenes in "Pulp Fiction" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in
                other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes
                these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys
                having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which
                they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in
                the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, "Pulp Fiction" wouldn't be
                "Pulp Fiction." I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow
                the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured. <br />
                <br />
                It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the
                story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing
                details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper
                explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. "Pulp Fiction," is, as the title indicates, purely an
                exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to
                other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or "art about art." It has all the characteristics
                we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of
                the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story
                does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself. <br />
                <br />
                The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy
                dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could
                easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small
                unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly
                desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on
                small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot
                developments. <br />
                <br />
                Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to
                consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could
                have simply told Yolanda, "Be cool and no one's going to get hurt," which is just the type of line you'd
                find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is
                like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement
                and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are
                full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, "That's when
                you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably
                enjoy the silence." <br />
                <br />
                What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power.
                Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the
                time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is
                the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to
                act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman
                whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of
                the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to
                describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with
                power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker
                characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially,
                and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our
                society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from
                the non-criminal world. <br />
                <br />
                There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out
                of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never
                sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be
                exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation. <br />
                <br />
                Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of
                the stories are really "about" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about
                burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it
                feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a
                better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.</p>
