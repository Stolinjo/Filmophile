            <h2>Mini Bio:</h2>
            <p>Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan
                was born on July 30, 1970 in London, England. Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone
                from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made.<br />
                </br>
                At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English
                Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimetre films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he
                learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a
                budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals
                prior to its theatrical release, and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather
                substantial financing for his next film.</br>
                </br>
                Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story
                by his brother Jonathan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy
                Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the
                critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and
                Hilary Swank.</br>
                </br>
                The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman
                franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero,
                and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving
                on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006),
                starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and
                murder.</br>
                </br>
                In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008) which went on to gross more than
                a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America
                (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award,
                and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations.</br>
                </br>
                In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller Inception (2010), which he directed and
                produced from his own original screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster,
                earning more than $800,000,000 dollars and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the
                year. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including
                Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with D.G.A. and P.G.A. Award
                nominations, as well as a W.G.A. Award for his work on the film.</br>
                </br>
                One of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded
                Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan
                to produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), which opened in the summer of 2013. In
                2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the science fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring Matthew
                McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film
                on November 5, 2014 to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million
                dollars worldwide.</p>
