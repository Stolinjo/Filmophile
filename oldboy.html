            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p>Abducted on a rainy night in 1988, the obnoxious drunk, Oh Dae-Su, much to his surprise, wakes up locked
                in a windowless and dilapidated hotel room, for an unknown reason. There, his invisible and pitiless
                captors will feed him, clothe him, and sedate him to avert a desperate suicide--and as his only
                companion and a window to the world is the TV in his stark cell--the only thing that helps Oh Dae-Su
                keep going is his daily journal. Then, unexpectedly, after fifteen long years in captivity, the
                perplexed prisoner is deliberately released, encouraged to track down his tormentor to finally get his
                retribution. However, who would hate Oh Dae-Su so much he would deny him of a quick and clean death?

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very
                often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring
                the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are
                plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I
                don't buy comments when people say "it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..." because it
                is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your
                head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of
                cruel genius!!!
