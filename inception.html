            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p> Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable
                secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most
                vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate
                espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.
                Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if
                he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of
                specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they
                succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the
                team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have
                seen coming. Written by Warner Bros. Pictures</p>

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew
                me away.<br />
                <br />
                Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was
                outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that
                visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult).<br />
                <br />
                The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type
                feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also
                enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a
                movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness
                in the end.<br />
                <br />
                Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie.
                If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a
                free show, it is worth every penny you pay.<br />
                <br />
                Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with
                this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.</p>
