            <h2>Storyline:</h2>
            <p>Theodore is a lonely man in the final stages of his divorce. When he's not working as a letter writer,
                his down time is spent playing video games and occasionally hanging out with friends. He decides to
                purchase the new OS1, which is advertised as the world's first artificially intelligent operating
                system, "It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness," the ad states. Theodore quickly finds
                himself drawn in with Samantha, the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending time together they grow
                closer and closer and eventually find themselves in love. Having fallen in love with his OS, Theodore
                finds himself dealing with feelings of both great joy and doubt. As an OS, Samantha has powerful
                intelligence that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn't, but how does she help him deal with
                his inner conflict of being in love with an OS?

            <h2>User Reviews:</h2>
            <p>I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful
                script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that
                Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy
                Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less
                successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and
                directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her. <br />
                <br />
                The story, taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than
                they do to each other, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man whose job is to write
                heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for
                a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality, and decides to give it a shot.
                His new operating system Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is not only intelligent but also
                charming and understanding, and she and Theo quickly fall in love. <br />
                <br />
                It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper, but in execution Her is far more sweet than
                creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence, and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure
                that it never becomes too self-serious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost
                In Translation. Like in that film, there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her
                and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness. <br />
                <br />
                Beyond the romance though, Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The
                people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each
                other entirely, not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around
                them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message, but it's communicated in a unique enough way
                that it works. <br />
                <br />
                I've seen Her twice now, and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the
                best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking, a deeply personal and thoroughly
                enjoyable futuristic love story.
